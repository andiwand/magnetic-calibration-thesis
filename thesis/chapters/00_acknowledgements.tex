I wish to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Ao.Univ.Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr.techn. Martin Gr√∂schl, my employer Esri R\&D Center Vienna and my manager and friend Thomas Taschauer. Without them, this thesis would not have been possible.

I want to thank my co-supervisor Dipl.-Ing. Dr.-Ing. Paolo Fogliaroni for proofreading my work and providing valuable feedback.

Further, I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me under all circumstances.

Last but not least, I want to thank my girlfriend Samira for always supporting and encouraging me throughout the whole thesis.
